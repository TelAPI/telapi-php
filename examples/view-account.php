# A 36 character long AccountSid is always required. It can be described
# as the username for your account
$account_sid = '{AccountSid}';

# A 34 character long AuthToken is always required. It can be described

# If you want the response decoded into an Array instead of an Object, set
# response_to_array to TRUE otherwise, leave it as-is
$response_to_array = false;

# First we must import the actual TelAPI library
require_once '../library/TelApi.php';

# Now what we need to do is instantiate the library and set the required options defined above

# Take note that you cannot set non-existing options

# it's a good idea to always do try/catch blocks while querying TelAPI
